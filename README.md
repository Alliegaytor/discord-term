Am extensible Discord terminal client. Can be used with bot or user tokens.

**Disclaimer**: Self-bots are against ToS and therefore discouraged. I am not responsible for any loss or restriction whatsoever caused by using self-bots or this software.

### Get Started

Setting up is extremely easy. Clone the repository and issue the following commands:

`$ npm install --global discord-term`

`$ dterm`

That's it! Although keep in mind that since the project is relatively new, you might encounter some bugs here and there.

**This project has been tested and verified as working on native Ubuntu terminal and Windows command prompt + PowerShell using Node.js 10**

Unfortunately, the background colors don't seem to work on Windows command prompt since it doesn't support it. I'm trying to resolve that issue tho.

Pst. Consider **starring** the repository if you like it! <3
